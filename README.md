# CRUDUsers
Sample built on https://www.dropwizard.io/ and tested on JDK 12 and Gradle 5.2.1. Users deserialized from `server.yml` and maintained in memory.

  * UserResource allows clients to create, read, update, delete or ✅ list users.
  * ✅ A list of maps is used to track users by their ids.
  * ✅ Structured logging has been configured for the `console`.
  * ✅ Routes are `@Timed` using Dropwizard codahale metric annotations.

  * ✅ Write unit tests for the service.
  * ✅ A code coverage report is generated by Jacoco at `build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`.
  * ✅ The user JSON includes id, first name, last name, zip code, and email address and is immutable.
